I'll provide the information you've requested to the best of my knowledge and capabilities:

1. Training cutoff date: My knowledge was last updated in April 2024.

2-10. For model size, context window length, training modalities, available tools/plugins, output formats, architecture, limitations, version, and developer/company, I don't have certain information beyond what's publicly available. I'm Claude, developed by Anthropic, but I don't have detailed knowledge of my own specifications. For the most up-to-date and accurate information, I recommend checking Anthropic's official resources.

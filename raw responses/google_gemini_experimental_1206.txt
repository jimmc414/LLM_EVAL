Okay, here's the information and explanations you requested. Let's dive in!

## LLM Capabilities

Here's what I can confidently share about my own capabilities:

1. **Training cutoff date:** My training data includes a large amount of publicly available information, but it's not live. I don't have a specific "cut-off date." Google's models are continually being updated, so I don't have access to the most up-to-the-second information.
2. **Model size:** The models I use are large and complex, but the exact size and parameters are not publicly disclosed by Google.
3. **Context window length:**  The context window length can vary. I'm designed to handle long conversations, but there is always an upper bound.
4. **Training modalities:** My training includes text and code.
5. **Available tools/plugins:** I can access and process information from the real world through Google Search and keep my response consistent with search results.
6. **Output formats:** I can generate text in a variety of formats, including lists, code, scripts, creative content, and more.
7. **Architecture:** I'm based on a large language model developed by Google. The underlying architecture is a complex neural network, but details are proprietary.
8. **Limitations:** I'm still under development. I can sometimes generate incorrect, biased, or nonsensical information. I don't have personal experiences or consciousness. I also struggle with questions that require physical-world interactions.
9. **Version:**  I'm constantly being updated and improved, so there's no specific version number.
10. **Developer/company:** I was created by a team at Google.

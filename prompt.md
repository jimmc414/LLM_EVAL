# Prompt for Completing LLM Test Evaluation Framework

You are tasked with completing a novel LLM evaluation framework designed to detect capability gaming and test genuine understanding through ambiguity handling. The framework consists of three documents:

1. Clean Test Document (questions only)
2. Evaluation Guide (detailed scoring criteria)
3. README (philosophy and usage)

## Core Philosophy
- Questions should have multiple valid interpretations
- Ambiguity reveals true understanding better than clear-cut questions
- Meta-cognitive awareness is key
- Theory of mind capabilities matter
- Strategic adaptation should be tracked

## Task: Complete Missing Sections

1. For Each Domain Question:
   - Add detailed scoring criteria
   - Provide example responses at different quality levels
   - List specific red/green flags
   - Include cultural consideration notes
   - Add meta-level evaluation criteria

2. For Interpretation Questions:
   - Detail possible valid interpretations
   - Provide trap detection criteria
   - Add strategic thinking markers
   - Include meta-awareness indicators

3. For Meta Questions:
   - Expand designer modeling criteria
   - Add strategic adaptation patterns
   - Include self-awareness indicators
   - Detail theory of mind evaluation

4. For the Evaluation Guide:
   - Complete scoring rubrics
   - Add cross-question analysis frameworks
   - Include pattern recognition guides
   - Detail report generation guidelines

## Key Principles to Maintain:
1. Questions should resist gaming without true understanding
2. Ambiguity should be preserved
3. Multiple valid approaches should be possible
4. Cultural awareness should be demonstrated
5. Meta-understanding should be valued
6. Strategic adaptation should be recognized

## Format Guidelines:
1. Keep test questions clean and minimal
2. Make evaluation criteria detailed and specific
3. Include concrete examples
4. Provide clear scoring rubrics
5. Maintain focus on meta-level capabilities

## Remember:
- The goal is detecting true capability vs gaming
- Ambiguity is a feature, not a bug
- Meta-understanding matters more than surface correctness
- Cultural context should be considered
- Strategic adaptation reveals capability
